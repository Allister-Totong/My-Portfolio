        <div class="container">
            <p>Create a Java program to search a missing person in a  pre-made map utilizing breadth first search algorithm.</p>

            <p>The map is created with graph with every vector representing districts. The districts are connected with edges. Each district is represented with rectangular panel </p>
            <p>To create the missing person, a random number generator is used to pick a number. Each number represents a  district. The missing person will be assigned a location when the button "Start simulation is clicked"</p>
            <p>Search party started at the gate of the city. As mentioned, a breadth first seatch are utilized to go through every district in order to find the missing person. The system would match the district with the location of the person's district.</p>
            <p>To indicate that the district is searched and the target is not found, the district is colored red. While when a district that is searched foud the person, it will be marked with green, and the search ended.</p>
